More information to follow!

April 22, 2011: We've branch 1.0! the 1.0 code has been in production at NISC for about 6 months now, and has been working great. However, we've recently started taking a look at some improvements that can be made, so we're going to take menagerie forward. To maintain compatibility we've done a branch so that you don't have to worry about backwards compatibility issues if you already have it in place!
Jan 29, 2011: ZkHashMap is ready to be tried out! More testing is probably in order before the @Beta annotation is pulled off for good, but it is close to completion. 

Jan 11, 2011: ZkSemaphore, a ZooKeeper-based implementation of a Semaphore, is now ready for the 1.0 release! 

Jan 11, 2011: A ZooKeeper-based Implementation of a ConcurrentHashMap is coming soon! To see current progress, check out ZkHashMap. It is already mostly useable, but a few more features and more testing warrant development.
